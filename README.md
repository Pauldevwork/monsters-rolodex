I built this project using React.js

It is built using functional components, and also hooks.

I use an api for the monsters (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) (https://robohash.org/${id}?set=set2&size=180x180).

I filter by id, name and email so I only extract that data from the api.

This was a fun project, it taught me how class components and functional components work and also the different ways to call an api, i.e life cycles in classes vs the functional aysnc api call.

what I got from this project was functional components are by far the better way to go when building with React.js, class components seem to be alot more complex, yes, hooks are confusing at first,
but once you get your head around them they are more efficient for typing and you do not have to do so much mental gymnastics to use them.

Structuing my projects.
It was a great simple project because it taught me how to manage my project files and folders (seperation of concerns). It has reinforced in me the absloute importance of orgnisation and structure and the overall
architecture of a project.

My DOM tree is structured as follows

       App
        |
|-------|---------|
H1  Cardlist  Searchbox
        |  
      Cards
